### HOW TO RUN:
- Execute `./dist/index.html` with any live server tool that allows js reading (CORS policy). Opening the file directly won't work

> FYI: Bonus was developed

### RECOMMENDED:
- firefox recent version (css subgrid support)

> ℹ️ If for any reason you would like to run the development server, install dependencies with yarn or npm, running: `yarn` or `npm install` respectively, next run `yarn run dev`.
> for build run: `yarn run sass-prod`, next `yarn run build`

### REQUIREMENTS/DEPENDENCIES:
-  nodejs 16.13.1 (developed in this version, but 14+ probably works)
-  vite 3.0.0 (bundler and development tool)
-  sass 1.54.3 (css preprocessor)
